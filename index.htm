      <h2>Exploring Delicious Orange Varieties</h2>
      <img src="img/orange-fruit.jpg" alt="Sliced oranges showing juicy texture and vibrant color for recipes" class="card-img">
      <p>Growing up in my family's orchard, I discovered the unique flavors of various oranges;from tangy blood oranges to sweet mandarins. Every fruit offered a different taste, aroma, and texture. These experiences inspired the orange recipes I now share. Using the right variety elevates both flavor and nutritional benefits in meals, desserts, and beverages.</p>

      <h2>Easy Orange Recipes for Every Occasion</h2>

      <p>Juice was central to our daily life, but our love for orange recipes extended far beyond. I’ve created smoothies blending oranges, berries, and bananas for a refreshing drink. Candied orange peels, baked citrus treats, and desserts highlight how every part of the fruit can be transformed. Years of experimentation taught me which combinations work best for both flavor and presentation.</p>

      <h2>Creative Orange Uses Beyond the Kitchen</h2>

      <p>Oranges are more than food—they’re lifestyle. I’ve dried peels for teas, grated zest for recipes, and pressed oils for natural home fragrances. Using every part of the orange adds sustainability to daily life. Simple practices, like using zest to enhance a dish, connect us with natural living and make everyday meals more vibrant and aromatic.</p>

      <p>Visual storytelling is key in orange recipes. Illustrations and graphics complement recipes, inspire menus, and enhance presentations. By pairing visual art with food, I help readers connect emotionally with citrus culture, memory, and tradition.</p>
