            <h3>About the Author</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Charis Doe, and my lifelong connection to oranges began in my father’s orchard, 
                where I learned the art of cultivating and savoring fresh citrus. Those childhood experiences harvesting fruit, 
                learning family orange recipes, and appreciating natural ingredients shaped my passion. Today, through Oranges Orchard Recipes, 
                I share tested orange recipes that honor tradition while inspiring new citrus ideas.
